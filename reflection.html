        Responsive design :- <br>
        &emsp; &emsp;
        Responsive design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used in designing a webpage that looks good on devices of various screen sizes and is suitable to work on as many devices as possible. This makes the site easy to use and easy on the eye. Therefore, one make websites 'responsive'; meaning the design responds to the specification of the device. <br>

        <br>

        Core principles of Responsive design :- <br>
        Fluid Layouts &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;:- 
        &nbsp;This layout is used to create web pages that adapts to the current viewport width and height. An example of this is using max-width property and using using percentages instead of fixed pixel widths. 
        <br>
        Responsive Units &nbsp;:- 
        &nbsp;There are two types of css units namely Absolute Length Unit and Relative Length unit. An Example of absolute and relative lengths are as follows - px; relative to the viewing device and em; relative to the font-size of the element. 
        <br>
        Flexible images &emsp;:- 
        &nbsp;Images aren't naturally fluid. They will remain static and so it's important to apply css commands like percentages for the dimensions, along with max-width property so that they fit the layout.
        <br>
        Media Queries &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:- 
        &nbsp;These allow individuals to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport. 
        <br><br>

        Responsive design in relation to web technology :- <br>
        &emsp; &emsp;
        Responsive design is very important because many new devices are coming out. Majority of people on the planet, own some sort of technology. About eighty percent; an ever-growing percentage of these devices are smartphones. These devices allow users to browse websites and expect websites to be friendly. If one cannot satisfy these expectations and growing demands, one will miss out on a lot of viewers. This is where responsive design comes in place - increased traffic from mobile users, seamless user experience, adaptability and finally great likelihood in SEO efforts.
