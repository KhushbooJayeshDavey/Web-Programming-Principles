        Introducing client-side form validation :- <br> <br>
        In this final assessment, I used client-side validation which is done on the client using script languages. I used JavaScript for better user experience, responsiveness, and visually rich validation. The goal of this web form is to ensure that the user provides necessary information needed in order to complete an operation. Examples of form use are educational websites, e-commerece websites, online banking and so on. <br><br>

        Honesty statement :- <br> <br>
